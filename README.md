# LaTeX Templates
Here you may find my __LaTeX Templates__ for the following documents:
- __Annotated Bibliography:__ A template for organize bibliographic references, where you should include a summary of the papers/book read, as well as, an evaluation where you express your opinion.
- __Master Thesis:__ The template I developed for my Master Thesis in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico (IST). Apart from the Introduction and Conclusion, the document is divided in two main parts, one intended for the Background and another for the Evaluation. The main text contains two columns one for the text and one for the figures.
- __Scientific Article:__ 
  - A two column template for scientific articles or academic reports;
  - A one column template similiar to the one used by the CAADRIA conference.
