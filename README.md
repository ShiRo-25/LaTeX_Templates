# LaTeX Templates
Here you may find my __LaTeX Templates__ for the following documents:
- __Annotated Bibliography:__ A template for organize bibliographic references, were should include a summary of the papers/book you read, as well as, an evaluation where you express your opinion.
- __Master Thesis__ The template I developed for my Master Thesis in Instituto Superior Técnico (IST). Apart from the Introduction and Conclusion, the document is divided in two main parts, one intended for the Background and another for the Evaluation. The main text contains two columns one for the main text e another one just for images.
- __Scientific Article__ (still on hold)
